# Configuration explanation below ~ 
#
# ALL TIMES ARE IN SECONDS!
# Initial delay is the time before the plugin starts starting 
# the commands in the schedule. This is in place so that other
# plugins have the time to start. You could set this to 0, 
# but errors may occur.
# Make sure the Command1, Command2, Command3 etc. are numbered
# in succession. This will ensure they all load.
#
# Also make sure you enter a command, heh.
#
# 1 minute = 60 seconds. 1 hour = 3600 seconds
# HOUR in 24-hour format!
# SpecificTime commands ALWAYS repeat!
